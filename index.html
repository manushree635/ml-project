        <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
        <h3>Problem:</h3>
        <p>Given that social media platforms have a big impact on our mental health, is there a way to determine a user's mental health status based on factors such as use time?</p>
        
        <h3>Motivation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Social media has made a controversial impact on the lives of many people around the world</li>
            <li>Some users have been able to grow their brand and image</li>
            <li>Others have negative experiences in regards to mental health
                <ul>
                    <li>E.g. Some teens reported bullying using Instagram</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Literature Review</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SOCIAL MEDIA USE AND DEPRESSION AMONG U.S. YOUNG ADULTS:</strong> 1787 Adults were surveyed about how much they use social media and their level of depression. Findings showed a strong correlation between the two.</li>
            <li><strong>Predicting Depression via Social Media:</strong> Posts of social media users who reported symptoms of depression were collected, and used to predict depression based on posting patterns. Findings showed it may be possible to predict depression based on post content and frequency.</li>
            <li><strong>The Relationship Between Facebook Use and Well-Being:</strong> Activities of Facebook users were used to measure user's psychological well being. Findings showed that communication with people users were close to in real life directly influenced their perceived well being.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Database Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/social-media-usage-and-emotional-well-being/data" target="_blank">Kaggle Dataset</a></p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This dataset contains a thousand data points that contains information about users' activity on a social media platform like Instagram. Attributes in this dataset include biological info like age and metric collected info like daily usage time. The dataset's main purpose is centered around how users interaction with a social media platform has an effect on their mental health.</p>

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <h3>Preprocessing Methods:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dataset has 10 features for every row (user)</li>
                    <li>To conduct data analysis, we need to remove features that aren't necessarily essential for all users</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data for the most part is great, but outliers might exist</li>
                    <li>Want to remove outliers so it doesn't affect results of future testing and our project, overall</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Imbalance Data:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quick look shows imbalance of features like gender (45% male to 29% non-binary)</li>
                    <li>Must use techniques like resampling or assigning weights to deal with potential issues in classification</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ML Methods:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>K-Nearest Neighbors:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Like K-Means, we want to use feature classification</li>
                    <li>However, we can make use of the training data to see if we have a higher accuracy in mapping similar data points to each other</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>K-Means:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>We plan to solve this problem using feature classification</li>
                    <li>Allows us to use multi-class classification to see what data points are closely related to each other</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>We want to see what values of our features need to be around to see if they belong to a specific emotion (e.g. Anxiety)</li>
                    <li>Logistic Regression can help because we can calculate the probability a datapoint belongs to a specific emotion or perhaps even an outlier</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Quantitative Metrics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Precision:</strong> To improve our accuracy this will be a useful metric to help figure out if we are misclassifying true positives</li>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Our aim is for the model to be at least 95% accurate. After working with the data more we may aim for higher/lower</li>
            <li><strong>F1-score:</strong> This will also help improve accuracy and give additional insight into how we are misclassifying information</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Goals & Expected Results</h2>
        <h3>Expected results:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We expect to see a negative effect on mood the higher the amount of time a user spends on social media</li>
            <li>If there is a correlation, we expect to be able to predict a user's mood based on that</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Classify mood based on social media usage</li>
            <li>Show correlation between social media usage and mood</li>
        </ul>
